# Biomedical-Engineering
In this repository, we explore two projects from the Fundamentals of Biomedical Engineering course.

# CA1
The first project focuses on analyzing EEG signals, filtering them to specific frequency ranges, and identifying the individual's state based on the processed signals.
# CA2
In the second project, we design a circuit using Multisim software to amplify EEG and ECG signals while simultaneously reducing their noise.
